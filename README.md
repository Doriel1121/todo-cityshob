* I added the .env file so you will be able to use the full functionality of the app, I used it only to demonstrate best practice.

In order to start the frontend:

1. install dependencies: npm install
2. run the app: npm start

in order to start the backend:

1. install dependencies: npm install
2. run the app: npm start

## Frontend:

I used socket.io in order to gain real time data synchronization.

## server:

I used the repository design pattern, which serve as kind of gate way to the data storage mechanism.
Its encapsulate data access details.

I also created a repository factory in order to gain more easy way to create and handle new and existing repositories.
